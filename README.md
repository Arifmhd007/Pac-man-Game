# Pac-man-Game
This project is a console-based version of the classic Pac-Man game written entirely in the C programming language. It runs in a Windows environment and uses simple ASCII graphics to create a playable maze. The program demonstrates concepts of array manipulation, keyboard input handling, and basic animation techniques.

How to Run
Compile the code using any C compiler that supports Windows console functions (e.g., MinGW or MSVC):
gcc pacman.c -o pacman
Run the executable:
pacman.exe
